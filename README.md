# Hello-World
Saying Hello to the World, One program at a time

My name's Melvir, but you can call me Melvs or even just Mel or just Vir.

As a student, coding has become a part of my studies and I believe GitHub can help me in those studies. I also like Codin Game.

I prefer waffles over pancakes, but I will still eat pancakes if offered to me.
